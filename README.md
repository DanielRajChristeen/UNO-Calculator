## UNO Calculator

The "UNO Calculator" is an Arduino UNO-based project that implements a basic calculator with a 4x4 keypad and a 16x2 LCD display. This project allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Note that this version does not include a clear function.

### Components
- **Arduino UNO**: Microcontroller for processing inputs and controlling the display.
- **4x4 Keypad**: Input device for entering numbers and operations.
- **16x2 LCD Display**: Output device for showing inputs and results.
- **Breadboard and Wires**: For connecting components.
- **Power Supply**: To power the Arduino and peripherals.

### Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Real-Time Display**: Inputs and results are displayed in real-time on the 16x2 LCD.

### Software and Libraries
- **Arduino IDE**: Used for writing and uploading code.
- **LiquidCrystal Library**: Manages the LCD display.
- **Keypad Library**: Interfaces the keypad with the Arduino.

### Simulation
- **Proteus Software**: Includes a simulation file for testing the calculator virtually before assembling the hardware.

### How It Works
1. **Keypad Input**: Enter numbers and operations via the keypad.
2. **Processing**: The Arduino UNO processes the inputs to perform calculations.
3. **Output**: The results are shown on the 16x2 LCD display.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Assemble the Circuit**: Connect the keypad and LCD to the Arduino using a breadboard.
2. **Write the Code**: Use Arduino IDE with the necessary libraries.
3. **Simulate**: Test the setup using the Proteus simulation file.
4. **Upload and Test**: Upload the code to the Arduino and test the hardware.

### Applications
- **Educational Tool**: Great for learning about Arduino and electronic interfacing.
- **DIY Project**: Ideal for hobbyists looking to build a simple calculator.

This project provides hands-on experience with microcontroller programming, component interfacing, and circuit simulation.
