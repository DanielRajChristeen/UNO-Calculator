### UNO Calculator

#### Overview
The "UNO Calculator" is a functional calculator implemented using the Arduino UNO microcontroller. This project demonstrates how to interface a keypad and a 16x2 LCD display with the Arduino UNO to perform basic arithmetic operations. Additionally, a simulation file in Proteus software is provided, enabling users to simulate and visualize the working of the calculator before actual hardware implementation.

#### Components
- **Arduino UNO**: The central microcontroller that processes inputs and controls the display.
- **4x4 Keypad**: Used for inputting numbers and arithmetic operations.
- **16x2 LCD Display**: Displays the inputted numbers and results of calculations.
- **Breadboard and Connecting Wires**: For assembling the circuit components.
- **Power Supply**: To power the Arduino UNO and connected components.

#### Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Function**: Allows the user to clear the input and start a new calculation.
- **Real-Time Display**: The 16x2 LCD displays the input and the result in real-time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface with a familiar keypad layout.

#### Software and Libraries
- **Arduino IDE**: Used to write and upload the code to the Arduino UNO.
- **LiquidCrystal Library**: To control the 16x2 LCD display.
- **Keypad Library**: To interface the keypad with the Arduino.
